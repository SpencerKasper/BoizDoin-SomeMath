Uber Tycoon Outline

You start off with a map as the main screen (think google maps) and people pop-up on this map and you send an uber to pick them up. 
In the beginning you only have like one car and you can buy more as you make money. And basically you pick the person up and  send them to their destination. 
As you get more cars, you can do more rides at once.

You'll only have part of the map unlocked in the beginning and random trips will take you out side the unlocked section and that would unlock other parts of the map. 
Or maybe you unlock other parts of the map after a certain amount of trips you complete/maybe both ways unlock map parts.

Possibly using MapBox for the game maps.

Utilize AWS Amplify for easier integration of back-emd/user services.
