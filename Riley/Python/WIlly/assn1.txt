This assignment felt pretty easy, was able to complete it in about an hour to an hour and a half’s worth of time. I struggled a little bit with entering an input command for integers and using that as a part of taking the total average, but after some guess and check and utilizing the int() command properly, I was able to figure it out.

1) The / operator is regular division where the decimal points float to the needed number. The // operator is also a division command, however, this one will always give an integer and will round down. The % operator doesn’t divide, but shows the remainder of the two numbers if they were to be divided.
2) An error occurs if you don’t specify the val integer as a string. You can do this by either surrounding the number with quotes or by typing in str().
>>> val = 8
>>> "The answer is " + val
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<pyshell#14>", line 1, in <module>
    "The answer is " + val
TypeError: must be str, not int
>>> val = "8"
>>> "The answer is " + val
'The answer is 8'
3) Int() gives the pure integer of a number, whereas the float() will give however many decimal places the number requires.
>>> int(10)
10
>>> float(10)
10.0
